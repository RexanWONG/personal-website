Being the only under-18 to win the competition, and competiting against the best and most hardcore developers in the Web3 space, out of 515 projects, I learnt a lot more about Web3 and blockchain development during the course of the hackathon and it encouraged me to build blockchain applications more : the fact that I could compete, as a 15 year old, at the time, against the top developers of the Web3 space, and win, I am looking forward to build more applications for everyday users of Web3",

I built a privacy-focused decentralized zkApp that aims to enable anonymous and secure protests where participants can join and support various causes while preserving their privacy.  This hackathon was the most hardcore hackathon I've participated in : joining the hackathon, knowing very little about zero-knowledge (zk) technology, let alone building zk technology.  Throughout the process, I had to dive deep and learn all these new concepts while building my zkApp.  In the end, my project won first place in the hackathon, out of 40 other projects, and this victory provoked me to go further deeper into this tough concept of zero knowledge technology.",
